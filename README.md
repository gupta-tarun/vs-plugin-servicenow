## Features

**Develop Locally:**
`CodeOnLocal` allows you to develop your Script Includes projects locally. That means you can check-in your code into source control, collaborate with other developers, and use your favorite tools to develop Script Inludes.

**üìÅ Structure Code:** `CodeOnLocal` automatically converts your flat project on Servicenow into **folders**. For example:
If the api name space is given as test, it will make like this:
- _locally_:
  - `tests/`
    - `slides.js`
    - `sheets.js`

**üî∑ Write Scripts in TypeScript:** Write your ScriptInclude projects using TypeScript features:
- Arrow functions
- Optional structural typing
- Classes
- Type inference
- Interfaces
